## 🔹 Core Project — **Nebula**

A global decentralized ecosystem built entirely in Rust.  
It aims to provide the foundation for a **peer-to-peer digital world** — open, autonomous, and economically self-sustaining.

**Ecosystem Components:**
- ⚙️ **Kadnet** — peer-to-peer networking layer (Kademlia DHT in Rust).  
- 🗃️ **CosmaDB** — distributed, fault-tolerant database optimized for Kadnet.  
- ⛓️ **NebulisChain** — custom blockchain for incentives and governance.  
- 🛒 **NebulaStore** — decentralized app registry and distribution layer.  
- 💬 **Nebula Apps** — open source decentralized applications within the Nebula ecosystem, built on top of its core protocols.

## 🔥 Current Focus

🧠 **Currently focused on developing Kadnet** — the core peer-to-peer networking layer of Nebula.

- Building a **robust, decentralized communication system** using Kademlia DHT in Rust, allowing nodes to discover and interact with each other directly.  
- Laying a **strong foundation** for the broader Nebula ecosystem, preparing for future integration of distributed data storage, application distribution, and on-chain economic incentives.
